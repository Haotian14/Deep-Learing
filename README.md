# Deep-Learing
## Introduction
The gesture recognition database is a collection of near-infrared images of ten different gestures. In this notebook, we use deep learning and machine learning to build classifiers for these images.


## Problem State
How to accurately identify which gesture is in the presence of background information interference and classify it correctly.
